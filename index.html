        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Jeannette Kunzen. My friends would describe me as loyal, honest and artistic. Back in 2005 I graduated from 
        the Savannah College of Art & Design (SCAD) with a BFA in Graphic Design which was followed by an 11 year career at Harcourt School Publishers.</p>
        <p>After this my technical design knowledge has been applied to leasing and sales support materials at a Commercial Real Estate company, going on three years. 
        To balance my tendency toward company loyalty I also like to keep busy with new and varied experiences. Some examples of side jobs I have taken include working at a convenience store and painting murals.</p>
        Orlando has been home for the past 15 years with family roots that go back 3 generations, and I spent the first 18 years of my life in South Florida while my father practiced architecture there.
        Other places I've lived include Savannah, Georgia and Durham, North Carolina. Despite being a native Floridian I've been snow skiing since the age of 10 during family trips to Utah and Colorado.</p> 
        <p>My hobbies include fitness, crafts, and motorcyles. My ideal vacation would be spent traveling overseas. Some countries I've visited on my own include Austria and India.
        My husband and I are becoming seasoned travelers to Japan and try to get over there at least once a year.
